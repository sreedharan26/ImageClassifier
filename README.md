# ImageClassifier
This is a simple Machine Learning project which can able to predict the class of the image in a set of 10 different classes. The classes are mainly related to the fashion goods like 'Trouser', 'Shirt' etc.,
## Steps involved in making the project
### 1)Analysing the data:
The data is imported from the Tensorflow's datasets. The data contains an array of 2D-arrays and each 2D-array represents an image. The shape of 2D-array is (28, 28).
Each value of the 2D array is in the range of [0, 256).
